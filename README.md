# Simcoe County OpenLayers Map Viewer

## Live beta site can be found [here](https://opengis.simcoe.ca/public)

The goal of this project is to replace [this viewer](https://maps.simcoe.ca/public) using an open source environment. The existing viewer is built using the ESRI 3.x JS api/DOJO with the Web App Builder and ArcGIS Server.

This app is built using React, OpenLayers and GeoServer. Many components are configurable to point to your own WMS/WFS, XYZ services. Some components use a custom rest api, such as the search and property report.

**GeoServer Server Rest API end points need to be enabled for this app to work!**

It's built using a framework to easily create your own tools and themes (instructions below) using the provided templates. Control what layers, tools and themes are loaded using the config at the root of the src folder.

The Table of Contents (layers tab) utilizes groups in GeoServer.

Heads up. This project is <b>not</b> complete and missing many components but the "core" framework and design is in place. New functionality will be posted to the beta site above.

Contributions are welcome. Even if you only clone it and add tools to your own project, please share them back and I'll integrate them if useful.

This app works in conjunction with these supporting projects.
